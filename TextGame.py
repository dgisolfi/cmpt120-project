    #Lab Entrance
    ("You come to the entrance where a large metal door used to stand protecting the lab and the nerds inside from the"
    +" wilderness. There is now just a large opening leading into the dark lab. Head inside to further explore the lab")
    #servicedesk
    (" Entering the lab there is a service desk waiting dead ahead dimly lit only by the flickering CRT monitors left"
    +" behind. there seems to be nothing here but unless computers from the 90s and lots of crumpled papers.")
    #powercenter
    ("Huge generators fill the room, they are all shutdown as the main power switch is turned off,"
    +" the backup battery seems to be charged and is the only source of power for the lab currently")
    #Storage room
    ("Behind the door to the storage room lies shelves upon shelves of prtotypes of jetpacks, flying cars and hoverboards")
    #Computerlab
    ("In the computer lab there is little walking space as the room was stuffed to the max with as many cubicles that"
    +" would fit. There is a lone ceiling fan missing half its blades with plenty of trashed computers, paper and floppy"
    +" disks scattered across the room.")
    #datacenter
    ("Large mainframes hold mass amounts of data collected by the lab while it was operational,"
    +" including all reports of experiments and tests")
    #Testing Room
    ("In this room lies the finished technologies of the lab that where left, you see dozons of itmes that untill now only"
    +" seemed science fiction, including a small mech suit which you can use to get back to civilization.")
