+" behind. there seems to be nothing here but unless computers from the 90s and lots of crumpled papers."),
#powercenter
("Huge generators fill the room, they are all shutdown as the main power switch is turned off,"
+" the backup battery seems to be charged and is the only source of power for the lab currently"),
#Storage room
("Behind the door to the storage room lies shelves upon shelves of prtotypes of jetpacks, flying cars and hoverboards"),
#Computerlab
("In the computer lab there is little walking space as the room was stuffed to the max with as many cubicles that"
+" would fit. There is a lone ceiling fan missing half its blades with plenty of trashed computers, paper and floppy"
+" disks scattered across the room."),
#datacenter
("Large mainframes hold mass amounts of data collected by the lab while it was operational,"
+" including all reports of experiments and tests"),
#Testing Room
("In this room lies the finished technologies of the lab that were left, you see dozons of itmes that untill now only"
+" seemed science fiction, including a small mech suit which you can use to get back to civilization.")]
